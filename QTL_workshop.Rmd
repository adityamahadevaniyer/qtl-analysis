This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(qtl2)
?calc_genoprob

#Create a object called iron and read in crossdata- system.file locates files in the packages to load them
iron <- read_cross2(file = system.file("extdata", "iron.zip", package = "qtl2"))
 
View(iron)
summary(iron)
```


```{r}
#Probablity of pseudo or fake markers for each of the genotypes
names(iron)
head(iron$gmap)
#use the insert function to insert pseudomarkers between the typed markers
#define a map to insert fake markers, calculate probabilities one 1 per cM
map <- insert_pseudomarkers(map = iron$gmap, step = 1)
View(map)
head(map, n =2) #Look at the data
```


```{r}
#With the pseudo markers in place, we have everything to calculate genotype probabilities at these markers
#Calculate genotype probabilities (genoprobs)
pr <- calc_genoprob(cross = iron, map = map, error_prob = 0.002) #0.002 is genotyping error probability- default is 0.001
View(pr)
View(dd)
dimnames(pr$19)
dimnames(pr$`19`)
```


```{r}
(pr$`19`)[1:3,,"D19Mit68"]
(pr$`19`)[1:3,,"c19.loc4"]
(pr$`19`)[1:3,,"c19.loc5"]

#View the geno probabilities graphically
plot_genoprob(pr, map, ind = 1, chr = 19) #Looking in individual 1 
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
